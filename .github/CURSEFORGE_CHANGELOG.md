<h2>Version v1.2.0 - 2/5/2024</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What's Changed</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h4>
<p>- This mod now forces the 'Fix Effects When Changing Dimensions' setting of the PotionCore mod to be false, if PotionCore is installed (although this can also be disabled, but not recommended). This fixes the issue with respawning apprentices instantly dying.</p>
<p>- Fixed apprentice natural health regen when health is not near full</p>
<p>- Lang key fixes</p>
<p>- Artefact fixes</p>

<h4><strong>Features</strong></h4>
<p>- Buffed Explorer's Belt's journey time reduction 15%->25%. (Exposed this to configs as well)</p>
<p>- Apprentices can use swords for combat</p>
<p>- Added /resetapprenticedata <player> command. This purges the apprentice data of a player (and resets their max cap).</p>
<p>- Apprentices can use bows (if you provide them arrows)</p>
<p>- AI improvements and more speech lines</p>
<p>- Added new artefacts</p>
<p>- The Scroll of Amnesia item of Ancient Spellcraft can reset all spell slots of an apprentice</p>
<p>- Improved study progress persistence for apprentices. They can resume studying a spell.</p>
<p>- Improved shift click interactions with the apprentice inventory</p>
<p>- Before updating, please make sure you remove items from your apprentice's artefact slot, otherwise you might not find it after the update.</p>
<p>- More artefacts</p>
<p>- Implemented Talents! All apprentices now have a hidden talent that grants them a special ability. This is unlocked once the apprentice grows up.</p>
